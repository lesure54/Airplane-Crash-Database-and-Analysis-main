# Predictive Model for Airplane Crashes

## Introduction
This document outlines the detailed specification of a predictive model designed to forecast the likelihood of airplane crashes based on historical data. The model aims to identify the factors that contribute to airplane crashes and predict future incidents.

## Data
The data used for this model is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Aviation Safety Network (ASN). The dataset includes detailed information about airplane crashes, such as the date, location, operator, aircraft type, and number of fatalities.

## Data Preprocessing
Before building the model, the data undergoes several preprocessing steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing or imputing missing values, correcting data types, and handling outliers.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data, such as the time of year, weather conditions, and aircraft age.
3. **Data Normalization**: Scaling numerical features to ensure they have similar ranges.

## Model Selection
Several machine learning algorithms will be evaluated to find the best model for predicting airplane crashes. These algorithms include:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective model for binary classification problems.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.
3. **Gradient Boosting**: Another ensemble method that builds models sequentially to correct errors made by previous models.
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.

## Model Training
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. Cross-validation is performed to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted instances.
2. **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
3. **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
4. **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model's performance. Techniques such as Grid Search and Random Search are used to find the best combination of hyperparameters for each algorithm.

## Results
The final model is selected based on its performance on the testing set. The results are presented in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves are used to illustrate the model's performance.

## Conclusion
The predictive model provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to airplane crashes and helps forecast future incidents. The model can be used by aviation authorities and airlines to improve safety measures and prevent future crashes.

## Future Work
Future improvements to the model may include:
1. **Incorporating more features**: Adding additional data such as weather conditions, maintenance records, and pilot experience.
2. **Improving data quality**: Enhancing the dataset by obtaining more accurate and comprehensive data.
3. **Exploring advanced algorithms**: Investigating more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as deep learning.

## Usage
To run the predictive model, follow these steps:
1. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and cleaned.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train the model using the training set.
4. Evaluate the model using the testing set.
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
6. Use the final model to make predictions and analyze the results.
